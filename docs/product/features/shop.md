# Shop — product page & bag

**Status:** live · **Slices:** src/features/catalog (product UI), src/features/cart · **Routes:** /parfums/[slug], /panier
**Spec history:** specs/002-shop-product-and-cart (2026-06-07); checkout in specs/011-checkout-orders + 012-admin-integration-settings (2026-06-08)

## What it does (user terms)

A visitor opens a fragrance at `/parfums/<slug>`: an enlargeable gallery, the name and
collection, mood, description, scent notes, and price, with an “Ajouter au panier”
button. Adding opens a bag drawer and updates a header bag count; the bag (drawer and the
`/panier` page) shows lines, quantity controls, per-line removal, and a subtotal. The bag
persists across reloads. From the bag, **Commander** runs Stripe Checkout when configured
(otherwise it shows “paiement bientôt”); a paid order lands in the admin Orders back office. No
WhatsApp, no customer login.

## How it works

- **Cart slice** (`src/features/cart`): SSR-safe Zustand factory (`createCartStore`) with
  `persist` (lines only) + `devtools`, provided via `CartStoreProvider` (wrapped in
  `app/layout.tsx`). `lib.ts` has pure `cartCount`/`cartSubtotal`. UI: `AddToBagButton`,
  `BagButton` (count gated by `useHydrated` to avoid SSR mismatch), `CartDrawer`,
  `CartLineRow`, `CartView`. The header (shared) receives `BagButton`/`CartDrawer` from
  `app` as props/elements so shared never imports a feature.
- **Catalog product UI** (`src/features/catalog`): `FragranceGallery` (client lightbox,
  keyboard + reduced-motion), `ScentNotes` (server pyramid), `FragranceCard` (linked).
- **Routes**: `app/parfums/[slug]` (`generateStaticParams` + `generateMetadata`,
  `loading`/`error`/`not-found`); `app/panier` → `CartView`; `app/collection` — the catalog
  grid with scent-family filters via `searchParams` (`?famille=…`, URL-as-state,
  server-rendered, works without client JS). `Fragrance.family` + `getFamilies()` back the
  filters (CUJ-C).

## Decisions & gotchas

- 2026-06-07: Commerce model changed from inquiry/WhatsApp to **cart/bag** (LV/JPG style).
  WhatsApp removed everywhere; contact is email only. See `docs/product/overview.md`.
- 2026-09-07: the **“Nous appeler” CTA is gone** (issue #1) from the homepage contact section
  and the footer, along with `site.phoneNumber`/`telLink` — the number was never more than a
  placeholder (`+33 1 00 00 00 00`) and the brand takes enquiries by email.
- 2026-06-08: **Checkout shipped (Stripe).** `CheckoutButton` asks `GET /api/checkout` whether
  checkout is live, then posts the bag to `/api/checkout` → Stripe Checkout Session; the webhook
  marks the order `paid`; `/commande/merci` confirms + clears the bag. Gated on config (no keys →
  “paiement bientôt”). Credentials are admin-managed (`/admin/parametres`). See spec 011/012,
  ADR-0006, and `docs/product/features/admin.md`. Legal/CGV copy still pending.
- 2026-06-07: Bag is a **guest bag** persisted in `localStorage` (`karnain-cart`); the
  count is hydration-guarded so server HTML and first client render match.
- 2026-06-08: Catalog content is the brand’s **real copy + full notes** (spec 009); descriptions
  render multi-paragraph; cards show Nouveau/Best-seller badges. Admins upload photos to Supabase
  Storage (spec 010) — `Fragrance.images` holds repo paths and/or Storage URLs.
- 2026-09-07: **Rose des Bois left the public catalog** (issue #2) — dropped from the seed and set
  to `draft` in Supabase, so RLS hides it from anon with no app-level filtering. All six published
  fragrances now have a real bottle photograph; the tonal placeholder no longer shows in the grid.
- 2026-09-07: **`/api/checkout` hardened.** The bag is untrusted input, so its normalisation now
  lives in `normaliseBagLines` (`src/features/cart`) with tests for forged prices, unknown slugs,
  repeated slugs, a 5000-item flood and non-numeric quantities. Three fixes: the catalog is read
  **once** per request (it used to be re-read per item, so N items cost N round-trips);
  quantities **merge per slug**, bounding line count by catalog size (past Stripe's 100-item
  limit the Session fails _after_ the pending order is written, orphaning rows); and
  `success_url` no longer comes from `new URL(request.url).origin`, which reflects the `Host`
  header — a forged Host could land a buyer on an attacker's page with a real `session_id`.
- 2026-09-07: **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is the canonical return origin** for Stripe redirects
  (`checkoutReturnOrigin`), falling back to Vercel's production domain and only then to the
  request. **Update it when the domain moves to karnain.fr**, or buyers keep returning to the
  vercel.app host after paying.
- 2026-09-07: the webhook now also handles `checkout.session.expired` and
  `async_payment_failed` → `cancelled`, scoped to `status = 'pending'` so a late duplicate can't
  walk a paid order backwards. Before this, abandoned checkouts sat `pending` forever and looked
  identical to one still being paid.
- 2026-09-07: ⚠️ **`checkout.session.completed` does not mean paid.** The Stripe account
  (`acct_1HiYqIGlrIp4MYll`, mp-parfum.fr) has **Klarna, iDEAL, Bancontact and BLIK** enabled, and
  a delayed method completes its Session with `payment_status: "unpaid"` while funds are still in
  flight. The old handler marked such an order `paid` — i.e. the back office would show a bottle
  as sold and shippable before the money landed. An order now moves to `paid` only on
  `payment_status === "paid"` or a later `async_payment_succeeded`; the buyer's details are still
  recorded on an unpaid session so a waiting order is identifiable.
- 2026-09-07: **Stripe is wired in TEST mode.** Webhook endpoint
  `we_1UD0RdGlrIp4MYllsoTBrBCd` → `/api/stripe/webhook`, subscribed to the four
  `checkout.session.*` events the handler implements. The account also serves the **live**
  WooCommerce shop (endpoint `https://www.karnain.fr/?wc-api=wc_stripe`, both modes) — leave that
  one alone.
- 2026-09-07: ⚠️ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Vercel is currently the **Stripe CLI's** test key, which
  **expires 2026-12-06**. It is fine for proving the flow, but replace it with a dashboard key
  (or the live keys at domain cutover) before relying on it — an expired key fails checkout
  silently, exactly like the paused-Supabase outage did.
- 2026-09-07: **keys are best rotated from `/admin/parametres`, not env.** Verified live that
  admin-stored settings take precedence over the Vercel variables and apply on the next request —
  no redeploy. Blank fields keep their existing value, so one key can be rotated alone, and
  secrets are never rendered back into the form.
- 2026-09-07: a failed Stripe call now **rolls the order back**. The order row is written before
  the Session exists, so a bad key or a Stripe outage used to strand it — `pending` with a null
  `stripe_session_id`, and no Session that could ever expire it. Found by saving a deliberately
  wrong key through the admin: every checkout click minted another unreconcilable row.
- 2026-09-07: **Adaptive Pricing is disabled per Session** (`adaptive_pricing.enabled: false`).
  It was quoting a 195 € bottle as "DZD 31,322.04" to a visitor in Algeria. Set in code rather
  than on the Stripe account, because that account also serves the live WooCommerce shop.
- 2026-09-08: **`fragrances.images` is the only source of product imagery.** The studio
  photographs used to be applied by a code override (`getStudioProductImage`) that swapped them in
  at render time while the column still held the earlier renders — so the site showed one picture
  and the admin's edit form showed another, and no edit in the back office could reconcile them
  because the override always won. The paths now live in the column
  (`20260908150000_catalog_images_to_studio.sql`, seed updated to match) and the override module,
  its export and its tests are deleted. What an admin sees is what visitors see, and uploading a
  replacement actually replaces it.
- 2026-09-20: **a paid order now emails `vente@karnain.fr`.** The shop previously notified nobody —
  orders appeared only in `/admin/commandes`, which is what the client believed WooCommerce was
  doing for him. Sent over SMTP through the brand's own o2switch mailbox rather than from Vercel,
  because the domain's SPF authorises o2switch's IP and its DKIM signs what leaves it; a message
  sent straight from a serverless function would be unauthenticated for this domain and land in
  spam. A dedicated `no-reply@karnain.fr` mailbox does the sending, so no human mailbox password
  lives in the environment; `replyTo` is the buyer, so replying in the mailbox answers them.
- 2026-09-20: the notification fires on the **transition** to paid, not on the event. `markPaid`
  scopes its update to a `pending` row and asks for the changed row back, so a redelivered event —
  Stripe retries, and `completed` may be followed by `async_payment_succeeded` for one session —
  updates nothing and sends nothing. One sale, one email. It runs inside `after()`, so the 200 is
  already on its way to Stripe: waiting on an SMTP handshake would spend the retry budget on a
  courtesy email and make a slow mail server look like a failing endpoint.
- 2026-09-20: mail is **gated on config** like Stripe and Supabase — with no SMTP variables the app
  builds, tests and runs unchanged and simply sends nothing. `sendMail` returns a boolean and never
  throws: an order is paid whether or not the shop manages to email about it.
- 2026-09-08: **`/commande/merci` verifies the `session_id`.** It used to thank anyone who opened
  the URL and empty their bag while doing it. It now honours the id only when it matches an order
  this site created, then asks Stripe for the authoritative `payment_status` — reading our own
  `orders.status` would race the webhook, since a card buyer lands on the page a moment before the
  `completed` event arrives. Four outcomes (`confirmed` / `processing` / `failed` / `unknown`);
  a delayed method in flight says “en cours de validation”, never “paiement reçu”, and a failed
  payment leaves the bag intact so the buyer can retry. The mapping lives in `core/stripe/outcome`
  (no `server-only`, so it is unit-tested) and fails closed on anything unrecognised.
