# Product Overview

Karnain is a luxury perfume house based in France (current site: karnain.fr). This
project rebuilds the brand’s website as a refined, French-inspired showcase: elegant
collection and product storytelling, high-quality campaign imagery, and a low-friction
bag/checkout path — backed by a Supabase-managed catalog and an admin-only back office.
French by default with English under `/en` (spec 014); other locales are additive.

## What this product is

A premium brand and catalog website for Karnain fragrances. Visitors discover the
house, browse collections, read each scent’s mood and notes, view large product
imagery, add fragrances to a bag, and proceed toward checkout without friction. Editors
manage perfumes, collections, and content through an authenticated admin — no developer
deploy to change the catalog. The bet: a more luxurious, consistent, mobile-first
experience than the current site converts more browsers into buyers.

## What we will NOT do (anti-goals)

- No multi-seller marketplace — single-brand house only.
- No complex custom perfume personalization in v1.
- No full ERP / inventory-management system unless required later.
- No customer accounts in v1 — authentication is admin-side only (per brief). The bag is a
  guest bag (no login to shop).
- No online payment in v1 — payment, legal, and compliance are still in discussion. v1
  ships the full bag/cart experience; the checkout/payment step (Stripe) is a later,
  spec-gated decision.

## Experience direction

Anchored on the restrained editorial luxury the client cited (Maison Francis Kurkdjian),
evolving away from the current site’s utilitarian look:

- **Ivory canvas, ink text, hairline rules.** Color comes almost entirely from product
  and campaign imagery, not from UI chrome.
- **Refined serif display** for the wordmark, product names, and section headings;
  letter-spaced uppercase sans for nav and micro-labels.
- **Generous whitespace and large imagery.** Storytelling sections interleave with
  product presentation rather than a dense grid.
- **Calm motion.** Slow fades and reveals; always reduced-motion safe (see
  `../conventions/motion.md`).
- **Mobile-first and responsive**, French-inspired, visually consistent end to end.

Design tokens (color, type, spacing) live in `src/app/globals.css` per
[styling conventions](../conventions/styling.md). All copy is French or English and follows
[copy conventions](../conventions/copy.md).

## Commerce, data & platform (v1 decisions)

- **Commerce model: cart / bag** (standard luxury e-commerce, LV/JPG style). Visitors add
  fragrances to a bag, review it in a drawer and a cart page, and proceed toward checkout.
  WhatsApp is not used — it reads as mass-market for the maison. (Revised 2026-06-07 from an
  earlier inquiry model.)
- **Checkout / payment: Stripe, scaffolded (spec 011).** The bag → `/api/checkout` →
  Stripe Checkout flow, an orders schema, and an admin Orders back office (`/admin/commandes`)
  are built and gated on config: with no Stripe keys the bag shows “paiement bientôt”; adding
  keys + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` flips it live. Orders are admin-only (RLS); the server
  re-prices from the catalog. Pending: client Stripe keys + legal/CGV.
- **Bag is a guest bag**, persisted locally (no customer login to shop).
- **Data layer: Supabase.** Live — perfumes and collections read from the Karnain Supabase
  project; the in-code seed is the fallback when env is absent (e.g. local/CI). See ADR-0005.
- **Auth: admin-side only.** An authenticated admin manages the catalog at `/admin`
  (Supabase Auth, no public sign-up); visitors are never asked to sign in.
- **i18n: French default, English shipped.** French keeps the bare URLs, other languages
  are prefixed; see `docs/product/features/i18n.md` and ADR 0007.
- **Hosting: Vercel.**

## Current catalog (seed)

Six fragrances are published on karnain.fr today, uniform €195, grouped under the “Karnain
Addicte” collection: Tobacco, Cuir 90, Rose des Îles, Tentation, Sucre Addictée, Cherry
Je t’aime. All six carry a real bottle photograph (in `public/images/fragrances/`), so the
tonal placeholder no longer appears in the grid. **Rose des Bois is a draft** — it was pulled
from the public catalog on 2026-09-07 (issue #2) because no approved bottle photograph exists;
it stays in the admin and can be republished once one does. The source asset zip lives in
`public/` but is git-ignored — only the selected/renamed images are committed.

## Current feature map

Living per-feature docs: [features/](features/README.md). Journeys that must never
break: [critical-user-journeys.md](critical-user-journeys.md). The skeleton’s `task-list`
demo has been removed now that the real features have shipped (see
[features/archive/task-list.md](features/archive/task-list.md)).
